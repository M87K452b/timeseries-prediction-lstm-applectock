# Time Series Predictions for stock data**
  -Just download timeseries and check for dependencies and run TSP-LSTM.ipynb using jupyter notebook
  -Check for dependencies using versions.ipynb

### What I learned
* **Getting, cleaning and setting up a simple neural network using tensorflow.**
* **To make a univariate timeseries prediction by setting up convolutional neural networks for LSTM**
